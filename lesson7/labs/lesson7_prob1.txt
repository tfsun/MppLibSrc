A, ArrayList extends AbstractList class and implements Serializable, Cloneable, Iterable, Collection, List, RandomAccess interfaces.
B, public boolean equals(Employee e) is not a overridden function. it should be public boolean equals(Object e).
C, For the HashMap<Employee, Employee>, Using containsKey(Employee e) function must override the hashCode() function in class Employee.
D, The variable visited should not be calculated during the hashCode() function and equals(Object e) function.
E, 
	1, When the type D is a Class
		1.1,  B,C do not override the method(), D inherits A version of method();
		1.2,  B, overrides the method() but C does not override method(), D inherits B version of method();
		1.3,  C, overrides the method() but B does not override method(), D inherits C version of method();
		1.3,  B, C, override the method(), there is an complier error;
	2, When the type D is a Interface, the result is the same as 1;
